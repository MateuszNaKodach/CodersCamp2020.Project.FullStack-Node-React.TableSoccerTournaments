3. Tournament registration
4. Tournament tables module responsible for enable/disable tables during tournament
5. Division into teams and assignment to teams
6. Division of matches between teams - making tournament tree (still in progress)
7. Matches module responsible for starting and finishing matches


## Dependencies

The following technologies were used :

- Database: MongoDB / in memory save
- TypeScript
- Docker

- Jest
- MailHog
- Stryker

Our application follows the TDD approach and is almost **fully covered** by tests. The architecture has been designed according to the **DDD (Domain-driven design)**.


## Event Modeling

During this project we tried to use event modeling to model our application flow and for task division. We used for it miro web app.
